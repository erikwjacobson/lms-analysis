# LMS Analysis

This project consisted of multiple datasets containing information about course success outcomes and use of a learning management software for courses at a midwest university. Data from 2016 to 2019 of every course that utilized the learning management software was combined with student success data to determine how the use of this LMS might be related to student success rates. Results were presented to a department within the university for the purposes of improving use of this LMS tool to better equip students in online, classroom, and hybrid courses.

* All data wrangling and analysis was performed by Erik Jacobson.
